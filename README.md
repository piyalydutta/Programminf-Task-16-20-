 Java OOP Practice Programs

This repository contains five beginner-to-intermediate Java programs that demonstrate the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. Each program focuses on a specific real-world concept modeled using Java classes.



📁 Program 1: Shape Area and Perimeter

📄 File: `ShapeDemo.java`

**Description:**
Defines an abstract class `Shape` with methods to calculate `area()` and `perimeter()`. Implements concrete subclasses:
- `Rectangle`
- `Circle`
- `Triangle`

Each subclass overrides the methods and provides its specific implementation.

Concepts Used:
- Abstract classes and methods
- Method overriding
- Polymorphism

  📁 Program 2: Movie Review System
  📄 File: `Movie.java`

Description:
Creates a `Movie` class with:
- Attributes: `title`, `director`, `actors`, and a list of `reviews`.
- Methods: `addReview()`, `getReviews()`.

Allows storage and retrieval of reviews for each movie.

Concepts Used:
- Class and object
- ArrayList for dynamic data
- Encapsulation

📁 Program 3: Restaurant Menu and Ratings

📄 File: `Restaurant.java`

Description:
Defines a `Restaurant` class with:
- Menu items and prices
- Ratings
- Methods to `addItem()`, `removeItem()`, and `getAverageRating()`

Concepts Used:
- HashMap for menu management
- ArrayList for storing ratings
- Basic CRUD operations

 📁 Program 4: Travel Booking System

 📄 File: `TravelService.java`

Description:
Implements a travel system with a class that has:
- Methods to `searchFlights()`, `searchHotels()`
- `bookReservation()` and `cancelReservation()`

Simulates basic travel service features.

Concepts Used:
- Basic class design
- ArrayList/Array handling
- Simulated booking operations

 📁 Program 5: Bank and Savings Account

📄 File: `BankAccount.java`, `SavingsAccount.java`

Description:
Defines:
- A `BankAccount` class with account number, holder name, and balance.
- Methods for `deposit()`, `withdraw()`, and `checkBalance()`.
- A `SavingsAccount` subclass that includes an interest rate and a method `applyInterest()`.

Concepts Used:
- Inheritance
- Method overriding
- Encapsulation
